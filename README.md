# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis (Silver Tsunami)

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find out how many people are going to be retiring in the near future with Pewlett-Hackard. There are a large amount of people who will be retiring and the positions will need to be filled sooner then later to keep the company running flawlessly. The positions will need to be filled asap and the hiring will be vast to fill the needs of those retiring.
   
## Results
The challenge itselfs was straight-forward and honestly SQL seems pretty straight-forward with the code. The first deliverable we were required to present was to create a table for those who are retiring or who are currently aging to the point of retirement. The code for the first part was extremely straight forward and the output looked as follows ![image1](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/pictures-challenge/deliverable%201.png)

The second part was to filter out those to those employees who have had 2 titles to just their most recent and to remove duplicates of the same employee who has changed titles over the years. ![image2](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/pictures-challenge/deliverable%201-2.png) 

Then we figure out how many of each title are going to retire in the near future which looked like the following. ![image3](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/pictures-challenge/deliverable1-3.png) 
The code for all of deliverable 1 looks as follows and will return all of the results including adding the tables to the database.

Next we go onto the mentoryship eligibility program which shows which employees are eligible to be part of the mentorship program to im assuming train the newly hired employees. This was probably the most intricate part of the code however still much easier then python. the output of the table is as follows.

And the code should look similar to this:

Which will provide the table and create a new table in the database.

## Summary

The results are pretty self explanatory. In brief there are many people in the company that are nearing retirement and these positions will be needed to be filled asap. And the mentorship program should help the transition along if those senior employees are willing to help teach the newbies. There are 72,458 employees that are nearing retirement in the silver tsunami and there are 1549 that are eligibile to be mentors for the new employees. That seems like a small amount but I personally think they can get the job done if they phase in the new employees over time. They could do a trickle down effect with the senior employees training the new employees and then as they are employeed they train more new employees. This will be no quick feat but I think with the right mindset Pewlett Hackard could accomplish the transition of a lifetime during this silver tsunami phase of retirees.
