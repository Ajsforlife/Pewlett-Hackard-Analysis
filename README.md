# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find out how many people are going to be retiring in the near future with Pewlett-Hackard. There are a large amount of people who will be retiring and the positions will need to be filled sooner then later to keep the company running flawlessly. The positions will need to be filled asap and the hiring will be vast to fill the needs of those retiring.
   
## Results
The challenge itselfs was straight-forward and honestly SQL seems pretty straight-forward with the code. The first deliverable we were required to present was to create a table for those who are retiring or who are currently aging to the point of retirement. The code for the first part was extremely straight forward and the output looked as follows ![image1](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/pictures-challenge/deliverable%201.png)

The second part was to filter out those to those employees who have had 2 titles to just their most recent and to remove duplicates of the same employee who has changed titles over the years. ![image2](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/pictures-challenge/deliverable%201-2.png) 

Then we figure out how many of each title are going to retire in the near future which looked like the following. ![image3](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/pictures-challenge/deliverable1-3.png) 
The code for all of deliverable 1 looks as follows and will return all of the results including adding the tables to the database. ![image4](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/pictures-challenge/deliverable1-4.png)
